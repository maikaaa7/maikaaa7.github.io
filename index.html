<p>Hi, my name is Michaelynn but I go by Micha (pronounced like Micah!). I am originally from Guam but I've lived in Fayetteville for the majority of my life. I am 23 years old, about to be 24 in December, and I have a Bachelor's degree in English Literature (from UNCG)! 
<br>I absolutely adore my intial field of study but I recently found myself really interested in web/application design and development. I figured I take a few classes at FTCC and see if it's something I really want to pursue. So far, it's pretty fun! 
<br>I get confused here and there but I am enjoying it immensely :D</p>
