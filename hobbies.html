    <h2>Gaming🎮</h2>

    <p>
      I have always loved playing video games. I remember when I was about 4 or 5, my parents bought me a metallic pink Nintendo Gameboy Advance SP. I played on it for hours. Throughout the years I would collect various Nintendo consoles such as the DS Lite, the Wii, 2DS XL, New 3DS XL, and the Switch. I've also modded half of my consoles since it's so easy to do. It's very obvious that I am a big fan of Nintendo + handheld gaming. However, these days, I do find myself playing more on my PC. I actually built it myself! Which was a super fun and interesting process :D Although it was a bit scary at times due to the immense cost and fragility of some parts. Recently, I'm playing a lot of Fortnite with my best friend and solo queuing Valorant.

   <h2>Studying Japanese ⛩️🌸</h2>

   <p>
    My paternal grandmother was Japanese but she was adopted so she never spoke the language or knew much about her culture. I thought it would be cool to learn Japanese as a way to explore/experience what my grandmother wasn't able to. I actually took Japanese lessions back when I was a UNCG student. However, I haven't been the best at keeping up with my studying so I definitely lost some writing/verbal skills. I am making an effort at relearning the language though!

    <h2>Collecting Trinkets/Blind Boxes🧸</h2>
    <img src="hobby_trinkets.jpg" alt="Trinkets" width="350" height="200">
    <p>This is something I got into about 3 years ago with one of my best friends. We saw these cute figurines on TikTok and we immediately needed to buy some. Now our entire friend group is into it as well. Whenever we hang out, we buy literal hauls of trinkets and blind boxes, it's so bad for our wallets... Our current favs are Peach Riot figures, Labubus, and Smiskis ❤️
